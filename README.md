# 👋 Hey, I'm Will

I'm a self-taught developer exploring the edges of frontend tech, automation, and indie web projects.

## 🔧 Tech I Like Working With
- React, Tailwind, TypeScript
- Framer Motion, GitHub Pages, Node.js
- UI/UX design, simple animations, weird little tools

## 🚀 Current Projects
- Building psychedelic-themed web apps & educational tools
- Exploring affiliate marketing + crypto monetization
- Learning by building (and breaking) everything

## 🧠 Philosophy
I believe in clean design, fast iteration, and shipping early.  
I'm not here to build perfect code — I'm here to build **cool sh*t that works**.
